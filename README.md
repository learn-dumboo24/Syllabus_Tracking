# SmartPrep – Exam Syllabus Tracker  

**SmartPrep** is a mobile application built to assist students in systematically preparing for competitive examinations such as JEE, NEET, and other tests. Unlike basic syllabus trackers, SmartPrep ensures completion is based on **active problem-solving and revision**, not just passive reading.

- Subjects and chapters are organized clearly under each exam.  

### 4. Comprehensive Syllabus Management
